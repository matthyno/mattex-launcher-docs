To get started with launching rockets, you should start by using the basic thruster and the basic fuel tank (`tAfA`).
Then, click the big "Launch" button and see your rocket soar!
Well, not really soaring, just going up a bit then falling down... but we can improve!
As you do more :doc:`research`, you can gain better parts for thrusters, fuel tanks, and even get stabilizers!
